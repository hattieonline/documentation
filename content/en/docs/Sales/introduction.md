## The Hub

**The Hub** is your starting point. Interact with apps, find and explore data, and browse collections of apps.

## Apps

**Apps** are task-specific, purpose-built applications. Apps visualize data from Glennis platforms, and are designed to help you to better understand data.

## App Overview

When you open an app from the hub, you arrive at the **app overview**, where you'll see all the content that the app contains, such as sheets and bookmarks, and navigate between the different views.
